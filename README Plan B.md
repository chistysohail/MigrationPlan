# MigrationPlan

To compare pull requests (PRs) from two different GitHub repositories, especially when they involve different versions of .NET (4.6.1 and 6), we need to consider several aspects:

Functional Changes: What changes have been made in the codebase of each PR? This includes added, modified, or deleted features and functionalities.
Dependency Updates: Differences in dependencies due to the .NET versions.
Performance Improvements: Any performance enhancements or optimizations introduced in the .NET 6 PR.
Code Quality: Code refactoring, adherence to coding standards, and best practices.
Compatibility and Breaking Changes: Any breaking changes introduced in the migration to .NET 6.
Security Improvements: Any security vulnerabilities addressed or new security features introduced in .NET 6.
Here are the steps to compare the PRs:

Step 1: Clone Both Repositories
Ensure you have both repositories cloned locally.

***CMD***
git clone <repository-1-url>
git clone <repository-2-url>
Step 2: Checkout the PR Branches
Checkout the branches for each PR.

***CMD***
# For repository 1
cd <repository-1-directory>
git fetch origin pull/<pr-number-1>/head:pr-branch-1
git checkout pr-branch-1

# For repository 2
cd <repository-2-directory>
git fetch origin pull/<pr-number-2>/head:pr-branch-2
git checkout pr-branch-2
Step 3: Compare Changes
Use a diff tool or GitHub's PR comparison feature to compare the changes.

Using GitHub
Go to the PR page for each repository on GitHub.
Review the "Files changed" tab to see the changes made in each PR.
Compare these changes manually, noting differences in functionality, dependencies, and any other relevant factors.
Using a Diff Tool
You can use tools like diff, meld, or Beyond Compare to compare the directories if you have them cloned locally.

***CMD***
diff -urN <repository-1-directory> <repository-2-directory>
Step 4: Review .NET Specific Changes
Pay special attention to:

Project Files: Changes in .csproj files indicating different dependencies or frameworks.
Code Changes: Updates in code to utilize new .NET 6 features.
Performance Benchmarks: Any benchmarks or performance tests included in the PRs.
Step 5: Document Findings
Document the differences in a structured manner, focusing on:
Functional changes
Dependency updates
Performance improvements
Code quality and best practices
Compatibility and breaking changes
Security improvements

Merging PRs from two different repositories, especially when they are based on different .NET versions (4.6.1 and 6), can be quite complex.
Here are the steps and considerations to successfully merge these PRs:

Considerations
Compatibility: Ensure that the code changes from both PRs are compatible with the target .NET version.
Dependencies: Verify that dependencies are resolved correctly for the target framework.
Testing: Thoroughly test the merged code to ensure that it works as expected in the new environment.
Steps to Merge the PRs
Clone Both Repositories Locally

***CMD***
git clone <repository-1-url>
git clone <repository-2-url>
Checkout the PR Branches

***CMD***
# For repository 1
cd <repository-1-directory>
git fetch origin pull/<pr-number-1>/head:pr-branch-1
git checkout pr-branch-1

# For repository 2
cd <repository-2-directory>
git fetch origin pull/<pr-number-2>/head:pr-branch-2
git checkout pr-branch-2
Create a New Branch in the Target Repository
Choose which repository will be the target for the merge and create a new branch based on the target .NET version (preferably .NET 6).

***CMD***
# Assuming repository 2 is the target
cd <repository-2-directory>
git checkout -b merge-prs
Merge PR from Repository 1 into the New Branch
Add repository 1 as a remote to repository 2 and merge the PR branch.

***CMD***
git remote add repo1 <repository-1-url>
git fetch repo1
git merge repo1/pr-branch-1
Resolve any conflicts that arise during the merge process. Pay special attention to project files and dependency versions.

Resolve Conflicts
If there are conflicts, manually resolve them by editing the conflicting files. Ensure that the merged code is compatible with .NET 6.

Update Dependencies
Update the project files (.csproj, packages.config, etc.) to ensure all dependencies are compatible with .NET 6.

***CMD***
# Example: Update .csproj file
<TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
Test the Merged Code
Thoroughly test the merged code to ensure that it works as expected. Run unit tests, integration tests, and manual tests if necessary.

***CMD***
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test
Commit and Push the Merged Code
After resolving conflicts and ensuring the code works, commit the changes and push the new branch to the target repository.

***CMD***
git add .
git commit -m "Merged PRs from repository 1 and repository 2"
git push origin merge-prs
Create a Pull Request
Create a new PR from the merge-prs branch to the main branch of the target repository and review the changes.

Summary
Clone both repositories and checkout PR branches.
Create a new branch in the target repository.
Merge PR from the first repository into the new branch.
Resolve conflicts and update dependencies.
Test the merged code.
Commit and push the changes.
Create a new PR in the target repository.


Example code in dotnet 4.6.1 repo and dotnet 6 repo :
Below are examples of a simple .NET application in two different repositories: one targeting .NET Framework 4.6.1 and the other targeting .NET 6. Both examples implement a basic console application that outputs a message to the console.

.NET Framework 4.6.1 Example
File Structure
***Example***
dotnet461-app/
│
├── Program.cs
├── dotnet461-app.csproj
└── packages.config

Program.cs
***Example***
using System;

namespace DotNet461App
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello from .NET Framework 4.6.1!");
        }
    }
}

dotnet461-app.csproj
***Example***
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
packages.config
This file is used to manage NuGet packages in .NET Framework projects.

***Example***
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<packages>
  <!-- Add NuGet packages here -->
</packages>

.NET 6 Example
File Structure
***Example***
dotnet6-app/
│
├── Program.cs
└── dotnet6-app.csproj

Program.cs
***Example***
using System;

namespace DotNet6App
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello from .NET 6!");
        }
    }
}

dotnet6-app.csproj
***Example***
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>

Key Differences
Target Framework:
.NET Framework 4.6.1 uses <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>.
.NET 6 uses <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>.

Project File Format:
The .NET Framework project file might use the older format, but in this example, we used the newer SDK-style format for consistency.
.NET 6 projects use the simplified SDK-style project file format by default.
NuGet Package Management:

.NET Framework projects often use packages.config for managing NuGet packages.
.NET 6 projects manage NuGet packages directly within the .csproj file.

Example of Merging
To merge these two repositories, you would need to:
Create a new branch in the .NET 6 repository.
Merge the .NET 4.6.1 code into this branch.
Update the .NET 4.6.1 code to be compatible with .NET 6.
Here is an example of how you might update Program.cs from .NET 4.6.1 to be compatible with .NET 6:

Merged Program.cs for .NET 6
***Example***
using System;

namespace MergedApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello from .NET 6, including features from the old .NET 4.6.1 app!");

            // Old .NET 4.6.1 code, updated for .NET 6
            Console.WriteLine("This line was part of the .NET 4.6.1 app!");
        }
    }
}

By following the merging steps and ensuring compatibility with .NET 6, you can integrate the functionalities from both repositories.
